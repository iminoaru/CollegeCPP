/*1. Design a class Distance that includes following data members: feet, inches. It has the following member function:-
Constructor, that initializes the distance to 0,0 by default.
Parameterized Constructor that initializes the distance with some values;
give a check so that the inches part is always less than 12.0.
Display function
Overloaded â€“ operator to subtract 2 distances
Overloaded + operator to add 2 distances
